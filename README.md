It's a Cordova project .

This project call the web-service API provided from "peaches-express".

Meaning that I tried to use same program to run on Web & Mobile .

Actually the view contructed by jQuery Mobile is all the same in Web(peaches-express) & Mobile(peaches-phonegap).

But the behavior for fetching image , geolocation , file tranfer are different . 

So javascript in these two project is just 70% the same.


Conclusion : Javascript is cool !
